This project implements TWO complete deep learning models with full training pipelines, comprehensive visualizations, and production-ready code.The main purpose of this work was to understand how deep learning models are built, trained, and evaluated, and how they can be applied to real-world data.

The project started with selecting a suitable dataset and understanding the problem requirements. Based on the task, either image data or text data was used. Before training the model, the data had to be properly prepared. For image classification, the images were resized and normalized so that they could be processed efficiently by the model. For NLP tasks, the text was cleaned, tokenized, and converted into numerical form. The dataset was then divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure fair evaluation.

After preprocessing, a deep learning model was designed using TensorFlow or PyTorch. For image-based tasks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used because it is effective at learning visual features such as edges, patterns, and shapes. For text-based tasks, layers like Embedding and LSTM/GRU were used to capture the meaning and sequence of words. The model architecture included multiple layers with suitable activation functions to improve learning performance.

The model was trained using the training dataset for several epochs. During training, metrics such as accuracy and loss were closely monitored to track the model’s learning progress. A validation dataset was used to check the model’s performance during training and to reduce the risk of overfitting. An optimizer was applied to minimize the loss function and improve prediction accuracy.

Overall, this project successfully demonstrates the complete deep learning workflow, from data preparation to model implementation, training, evaluation, and result visualization. It provided hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks and showed how powerful these techniques are for solving real-world problems in image processing and natural language understanding.
